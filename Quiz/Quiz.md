This Python script creates a simple quiz application using the `requests` library to fetch questions from the Open Trivia Database API and `tkinter` for the graphical user interface. The `get_questions` function retrieves a specified number of multiple-choice questions. The `QuizApp` class initializes the application, displaying questions one by one with shuffled answer options. Users select an answer, and the application checks if it's correct, updating the score accordingly. Once all questions are answered, the application displays the final score and percentage in a message box. The script concludes with the main loop to run the application.
